ROT13 Challenge
===============

This is a collection of **ROT13** encoding programs written in different languages. *Just for fun*.

Feel free to participate - *fork, add, pull request.*

Your program should have **I**/**O** and that's how it's supposed to look (if possible):

```
Enter string to encode:
NOWHERE abjurer 123.
Encoded string:
ABJURER nowhere 123.
```

The file has to be named `main.<lang_extension>` if possible. It must be placed in the `<Language Name>` folder.
